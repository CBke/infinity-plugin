Actual State of Infinity (instead of history)
=============================================

Written by Duilio Protti on April 2004.

Infinity was originally written by Julien Carme on 2000.
Then the project has been freezed for a couple of years, from 2001 to
2004 I guess. I have found this plugin some time ago, I encountered really
beautiful and decided to improve it by adding MMX support. That was on
October 2003. From then I have tried ocasionally to contact Julien Carme
but that was not possible. Recently I have decided to reborn the project
because I feel this beauty must be on the desktop of any user that likes this
kind of plugins, and for that it must be maintained and must not die.
