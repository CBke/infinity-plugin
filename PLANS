Near future
===========

* Save window position on close.
* Rewrite modules to use a common datatype InfPlugin.

Future
======

* Give option to compile against Libvisual library.

Libvisual is a library that acts as a middle layer
between applications that want audio visualisation
and audio visualisation plugins.

Actually the Libvisual project has developed an XMMS
plugin that, when loaded, allows to run all the plugins
on the system that are linked against Libvisual.
The project has released also a package which contains
a lot of visualization plugins that have been ported
to use this library, including a port of the original
Infinity plugin made by the project lider.

The good thing of this library is that the plugins
are linked against the library itself, so can be used
by any client of the library, not just Audacity.
Other good thing is that the library take cares of all
the infrastructure needed by visualization plugins, 
including OpenGl ones, and the plugin writer must take
care only about the artistic stuff, that is, to compute
the frames to be shown.

The actual Libvisual implementation also allow to
gradually morph from one plugin to another, and have
many input plugins, so applications linked against it
can take audio from many different sources.
It's still under development, but the interface exposed
right now is really clean, and are good plans like a
builtin font system, so we could show song titles on the
rendered screen of any plugin.

Information about Libvisual library can be found at

Some day infinity will be closed as an independent project,
and will be maintained within the libvisual-plugins package.
