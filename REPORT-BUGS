Bug Reports
===========

If you encounter any bug on Infinity, on the building process, or 
an inconsistency on the configuration, or just a rendering bug,
please point your browser to

http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=649740&group_id=108158&func=browse

and fill a bug report. That will take you just a few minutes, and
will be a lot of help for developers and other users.
The report will be filled on a single HTML form on the SourceForge.net's
site of the project, and you don't need to have a user account there
to submit the report.

This report must include:

- version of Audacity used.
- version of Infinity used (I still interested on bugs of older versions).
- version of SDL used.
- version of Glib used.
- Linux distribution you use.
- X server implementation and version (usually XFree86).
- Graphic card and wich driver it uses.
- A short description of the conditions on where you running Infinity when
the bug was encountered. i.e. if other plugins were running when the bug
appears, if others applications were running, etc.
- A short description of the bug itself. Specially, you must show, if possible,
the output that was showed when the bug appears (to get that run Audacity on a
terminal). If the error is a configure or compile error, send the last output
showed.

After that, categorize the bug on one of the three categories:
- building process
- configuration
- rendering
and submit (every one of them are explained on the mentioned page).

And finally, don't doubt, every bug report is important, and will help a lot
to the development process of Infinity!
